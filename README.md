# Calculate_City_Values
From two different txt files we have different people going to different cities at different dates and stay at that city for the amount of days that is stated.
We are trying to locate if these people were staying on the same city at the same dates, if so how many days and what was the original date of that encounter date.
And we write those days into Output_1 and Output_2 and display the most encounterfull cities.
